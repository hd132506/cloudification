# Cloudification
Python based AI-as-a-service cloud system using split learning platform.

The ultimate goal of this project is to be used as an experimental environment for any study related to split learning with Pytorch. 



## Use case

1. The server initially sets pretrained model and split point then runs ***server.py***. 
2. Clients runs ***client.py***. They can 



## Initial Phase Goal

1. Make a simple server-client application (Done)
2. Pytorch environment Setup
3. Write a simple code to generate a trained deep learning model
